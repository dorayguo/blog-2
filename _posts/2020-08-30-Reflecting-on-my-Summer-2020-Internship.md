Summer 2020, I interned at Microsoft as an Explore Intern, which always reminded me of my childhood cartoon counterpart “Dora the Explorer”.

In all seriousness, I was very lucky to intern at a place with brilliant minds, hard work, and a welcoming culture. I learned a lot and from many people, so in this post, I will be reflecting on my learnings from these past three months. 

My learnings can be split into three sections: individual, group, and work. Many of these lessons were things that I learned from others, so many thanks to my great pod and team!

## Individual
### 1. to reflect
During my internship, there were moments where I felt uncomfortable or embarrassed from a mistake or action I did. It's easy to dwell upon those feelings or start overthinking, but the act of reflecting relieved me from those moments.

Writing out my thoughts, goals, and next course of action on paper helped contain my worries and uncertainty. As my pen writes out words one-by-one, my mind processes each thought one-by-one. I can see my goals clearer and work with confidence knowing that I can always come back to just pen and paper (sorry IDEs!).

Active reflection has been eye-opening for me too. After our first cognitive walkthrough, two PMs that worked with us made sure to group us all together right after and talk about what happened. Through various discussions with them and our pod, it became apparent to me that to push forward, we have to seize the momentum and active pursuit of reflection.
### 2. to initiate change
Reflecting is a continuous process that is built upon previous reflections. To prevent making the same mistake twice, change must be made.

If we stay the same, we make the same mistakes. So while we reflect, at some point, our vision can look towards the solution. That preparation can jumpstart visible improvement.

Lastly, there are things left to be done. To get them done, someone has to put in the time and effort. Give yourself courage and the confidence to step forward.
### 3. to run a marathon
Especially in a 12-week internship and a WFH setting, it's difficult to draw the line between work and life. But this was something many people emphasized. My manager provided this analogue of running a marathon, rather than using up all the "fuel" by sprinting.

It's important to have fun on your own time and bring yourself to work with a clear and driven energy. You want to be able to listen, make connections, and focus, present in that moment.

Our lives often flourish on a continuous timeline.
### 4. to have fun!
As humans, we aren't suited under long-term, high-stress environments. We need relaxation!

Having fun and doing work don’t collide. It's such a nice feeling when I achieve a balance between the two and everything is working well.

## Group
### 5. self-awareness
This is a piece of advice from our pod's dev mentor: to be aware of yourself and surroundings. I was able to use this advice to acknowledge any blockers/obstacles (especially bugs!) and take a step back for a bit or ask for help.

Another aspect of this advice is to acknowledge and think in the perspectives of others. This includes understanding their motivations and intentions, while also reading the mood.
### 6. audience-awareness
Work is done in a group. We should be in sync with our respective goals, so our work doesn't stray off far from the group.

Plus, knowing the audience's motivations enables efficiency and clarity. It is especially important for progress while we work remotely.
### 7. to provide others the platform to shine
Part of a team, I am responsible for supporting others and raising their voices. This is important in building the foundations of team work, as well as a path for the individuals in a team.

Also, people have their own expertise. Experts know more about their work than me. Trust in them and their work magnifies their capabilities and the resulting work.
## Work
### 8. quality of code
This internship taught me a lot about coding. Not just about getting the final result, but *how* we get there.

 - Modularity: avoids code duplication and encourages communicative structure in our code
 - Naming conventions: I didn't think much of this at first, but naming of variables, functions, and classes are important while coding with others.
 - Consistency: of the quality of code while delivering.

These build up from functionality and focus on the details. It reminds me of the previously-mentioned concepts of awareness. In this case, developers should be aware of how they code.

### 9. handling the dev env
Version-control! It's like remembering to save a Word document. We need something to save us when accidents or changes of mind occur.

When we commit to our current code, to version control, production environment, or just presentations to others, it is the developer's responsibility to check nothings breaks.

When we write new code, we need to make sure it doesn't affect an existing part of the system. Maybe that calls for further abstraction or suggests potential errors in our logic. But if it doesn't work, don't commit to the code if things break.

Be cautious while introducing new things to our dev environment. This includes adding things that are from different scopes, have dependencies, or aren't really known to you. Your dev environment is like an ecosystem, you should know the impacts of a new species has on your ecosystem before you drop it in there.

It reminds me to treat both our code and dev environment with detail and care.
## Summary
These were few lessons out of the many. Some I comprehended as much as possible, but some are still a work-in-progress (it's totally fine to *kinda* grasp an idea on them). 

Overall, this internship was an opportunity that opened my eyes to a diversity of backgrounds, thoughts, and work, shaping me into a better individual, team-player, and developer. It enabled a platform for me to be proud, humbled, and have fun.
