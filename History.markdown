#### Design Process
I was inspired by various other blogs and decided on a few factors for my website...
 - Simplicity: easy way of reading
 - Content-driven: contains only substance
 - Personality: feelings of adventure, coziness, and pleasantness

Here are my final website layouts:

I took a great deal of inspiration from [Tom Preston-Werner's blog](https://tom.preston-werner.com/), which has a clear display of content and minimal noise between page transitions.

For personality, I wanted to let visitors feel like they're taking an adventure, while feeling warm and cozy inside. 

For the background, I enjoyed [these designs](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/456411743490215586/). The paper-like texture and imperfections from the middle design are warm and personal. I really like the soft tan background color; it's as if one were reading a book. The moon and stars from the bottom design give a touch of fantasy and magnificence.

Here is a sample design of the homepage with color:

I chose an elegant and sweet font family. The contrasting and complementing colors allow easy shift of attention. To reduce clutter, I conveyed order through structuring the font sizes.

For the about me page, I carried on similar elements and color palette. I'm still deciding another possible background colors. This one is lighter and makes the website look cleaner.

#### Development Process
*December 14, 2020:*
The site is currently accessible through [dorayguo.github.io](http://dorayguo.github.io/). Because of build issues, I am currently modifying this site through Github. 

I will be gradually start adding blog posts and project content. Design integration will be delayed for now.

## Summer 2020
### Microsoft Explore Project
In a team of 3 interns, we designed and developed a C# API for developers to self-test their 3rd party SaaS applications for Microsoftâ€™s standards before onboarding to the [Azure Active Directory gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-howto-app-gallery-listing)

I worked on created robust test features to check SaaS applications for the correct effects and responses for PUT and DELETE requests and edge cases, as well as integrating the executable application into a local endpoint.

I also organized and conducted 10 cognitive walkthroughs with existing customers to collect feedback on our previous onboarding process and our future design.

#### Quantifiables
 -  Automated process time to check SaaS application for correct configurations from 6 months to *2 weeks*
 - Identified 6 issues in existing onboarded applications with updated testing standards
